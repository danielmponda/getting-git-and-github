                One can certainly write some reasonably large and complex programs
                by themselves - however, depends on the scale and complexity of
                the project, software development can take weeks, months or even
                years and can’t simple be done by one person. To complete and
                distribute a given project in a reasonable amount of time, you may
                need more than one person working on a given project. Today, a
                team of developers is responsible for most software builds. For
                instance, both Google and Facebook have hundreds of software
                Engineers working and running their respective sites
                simultaneously. To commodity this many software Engineers working
                concurrently on a single project can be problematic.
              </p>

                <p>
                  Just to mention some of the challenges. <br /><br />

                  - With hundreds of developers working on a single project
                  simultaneously, how do we keep track on who made a changed, what
                  have been changed and when did the change occur? <br />
                  <br />
                  - How to Integrate and synchronize the work that is done
                  simultaneously by different members of the team. Especially when
                  conflicting edits are made by two people to the same line of a
                  file. <br />
                  <br />
                  - How do we keep history of changes and historical versions of a
                  project in case something goes totally wrong?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The solution to this is to develop a system which could provide
                  a logical method that preserves the individual contributions of
                  team members without overwriting another developer's work, and
                  then merges and reconciles changes and updates. The systems
                  should be able to produce a historical record which can be used
                  to track down problem origins or archive versions for later use,
                  this is what Version Control Systems attempts to do.

                <br />
                Version control systems are a category of software tools /
                utility that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem, it
                provides collaborative utilities to share and integrate these
                filesystem changes by those contributing to a given project.
                Version control systems will track the addition, deletion, and
                modification actions applied to files and directories. When a
                filesystem is traced this is refereed to as a repository.

                <b> Git and GitHub</b>
                 <br /><br />
                Git being a distributed version control system, has a remote
                repository which is stored in a server and a local repository
                which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means
                that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the
                full copy of the code is present in all the developers’
                computers. in order to have a central server repository you
                need firm that from hosting server for your central server
                repository, luckily there are companies out there who are
                willing to host your central repositories. Such companies
                include, GitHub and Bitbucket. <br /><br />

                GitHub, is simply an American multinational corporation that
                provides hosting for software development and version control
                using Git for free. It offers the distributed version control
                and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus
                its own features.
                <br /><br />
                In order to use Git and GitHub in your project, you first need
                to download Git to track all your filesystems using your local
                repository and set up a remote repository on the GitHub
                website.
